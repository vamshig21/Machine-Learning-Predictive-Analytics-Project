# Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics-Project

This project focuses on the classification of stellar images into ten predefined categories using machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transfer Learning. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of four different models for the task of image classification. The four models considered in this study are a standard CNN built from scratch, a standard LeNet5 model (not pre-trained), as well as pre-trained models VGG-16 and VGG-19 with transfer learning applied.

To achieve the classification objective, the Galaxy10 dataset comprising of stellar images across ten categories is utilized. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to enhance the model's ability to generalize. The CNN architectures including the standard CNN and LeNet5, are designed and trained from scratch using the dataset. On the other hand, the pre-trained VGG-16 and VGG-19 models, which have been trained on large-scale image datasets, are employed by fine-tuning the models' weights and adapting them to the specific task of stellar image classification.

Performance evaluation of the four models is conducted using various metrics, including accuracy, precision and recall. Additionally, training and validation curves are analyzed to assess the models' learning capabilities and potential overfitting issues. Comparative analysis of the models' performances provides insights into the effectiveness of transfer learning and the impact of model architecture choices.

The results obtained from this study contribute to the understanding of the performance of different CNN models for stellar image classification. By evaluating and comparing the standard CNN, LeNet5, VGG-16, and VGG-19 models this can help determine the most suitable model for this specific task. The findings have practical implications for enabling efficient and accurate classification of stellar images based on predefined categories, which can assist others in their and analysis.
